===Document Text Style

Document text is dark on light and can also include a number of facets to set
the font, style, color, shadow, spacing, tabbing, and other attributes.

	text "Normal"
	text "Bold" bold
	text "Italic" italic
	text "Underline" underline
	text "Bold italic underline" bold italic underline
	text "Big" font-size 32
	text "Serif style text" font-name font-serif
	text "Spaced text" font [space: 5x0]

Document text also includes these predefined styles:

	title "Centered title"
	h1 "Heading 1"
	h2 "Heading 2"
	h3 "Heading 3"
	h4 "Heading 4"
	; tt "Typewriter text"
	; code "Code text"

!In RED, tt and code are not predefined. As for title, it's used to set the
window title.

===Text Entry Fields

Text input fields accept text until the enter or tab key is pressed.  A text input
field can be created with:

	field

To make the field larger or smaller, provide a width:

	field 30
	field 300

Fields will scroll when necessary.

Larger amounts of text can be entered in an area.  Areas also accept an enter
key and will break lines.

	area

You can also specify the area size:

	area 160x200

To force the text in an area to wrap rather than scroll horizontally, provide
the wrap option:

	area wrap

===Text Lists

Text lists are easy to create.  Here is an example.

	text-list data ["Eureka" "Ukiah" "Mendocino"]

Almost any type of block can be provided. Here is a list of all the files in
your current directory:

	text-list data read %.

There is no selection by default. The facet selected gives the index of selected
string or none value if no selection (read/write).

	layout [
		below
		chosen: text "empty"	
		all-days: text-list 
		data days: copy [ "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" ] 
		[ chosen/data: pick days all-days/selected ]
	]

===Images

By default an image will be scaled to fit within a face.

	image 60x60 %palms.jpg

Most other faces can accept an image as well as text:

	box 100x100 %palms.jpg
	button "Button" %palms.jpg

The image can be provided as a filename, URL, or image data.

===Backdrops

A backdrop can be a color, or an image. For example a backdrop color would be
written as:

	backdrop navy
	text "Color Backdrop" gold

A backdrop image can be a file, URL, or image data:

	backdrop %palms.jpg
	text "Image Backdrop" red
