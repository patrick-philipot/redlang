{ Red code to be tested (RED 0.66 macos Mojave)

===Origin

!From http://www.rebol.com/docs/view-guide.html

Setting the origin is especially important when creating panels and lists.
Frequently the origin in lists is set to zero. For example:

	text bold navy white "Films:"
	list 144x60 [
	    origin 0x0
	    across
	    text 60
	    text 80
	] data [
	    ["Back to the Future" "1:45"]
	    ["Independence Day" "1:55"]
	    ["Contact" "2:15"]
	]

!Note that this code causes an error in RED.
