===BELOW

BELOW specifies a vertical layout for faces that follow it. It is used along
with ACROSS for auto layout of faces. BELOW is the default layout direction
when none is specified. For example:

	button "Button 1"
	button "Button 2"
	button "Button 3"

You can switch between BELOW and ACROSS at any time during a layout. When
BELOW is used, faces will be positioned below the current face.

	across
	button "Button 1"
	button "Button 2"
	return
	below
	button "Button 3"
	button "Button 4"

===ACROSS

ACROSS specifies a horizontal layout for faces that follow it. It is used
along with BELOW for auto layout of faces. When ACROSS is used, faces will
be located to the right of the current face.

	across
	button "Button 1"
	button "Button 2"
	button "Button 3"

RETURN advances the position to the next row or column, depending on the
layout direction. If the layout direction is across, return will start a
new row. If the direction is below, return will start a new column.

	across
	text "Name:" 100x24 right
	field "Your name"
	return
	text "Address:" 100x24 right
	field "Your address"
	return

===FEEL/ENGAGE

The first example found in https://www.rebol.com/docs/quick-start2.html is
the Digital Clock

	f: layout [
	    origin 0
	    b: banner 140x32 rate 1 
	        effect [gradient 0x1 0.0.150 0.0.50]
	        feel [engage: func [f a e] [set-face b now/time]]
	]

!WARNING this code won't work in Red. Neither fell nor engage are available.

	clock-face: base white red 400 font-size 64 rate 1
	on-time [ clock-face/text: form now/time ]

With Red you have to use rate and on-time.
