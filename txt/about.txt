{ Red/VID code to be tested (RED 0.66 macos Mojave)

===About it

This program allows you to easily test some REBOL/VID codes with RED. They are
loads of them available. In addition, if you have REBOL installed on the same
machine, it's possible to run the code with REBOL and see the result for comparison.

!Simply click the "Test with rebol" check

In order to test your code, you need a simple text file (ex: mycode.txt) formatted
like the screen your are reading.

A line starting with "===" is a title section. An empty line must follow. The 
current section title is "About it".

Consecutives lines, each indented by one tab characters, form a block of code. This 
is an example (you may omit the "view layout" for simplicty):

	view layout [button "Test it"]

Just provide the content of the layout block

	text-list data ["Eureka" "Ukiah" "Mendocino"]
	button 100 "click me"
	check "Are-you happy ?" [either face/data [print "Yes"][print "No"]]

!Click a block to run it with RED (and REBOL possibly). A line starting with an
exclamation point ! with no space after is a remark. A section is about 30 lines
long, so it's time to start a new one at this point.
}












Document text also includes these predefined styles:

	title "Centered title"
	h1 "Heading 1"
	h2 "Heading 2"
	h3 "Heading 3"
	h4 "Heading 4"
	; tt "Typewriter text"
	; code "Code text"

!In RED, tt and code are not predefined. As for title, it's used to set the
window title.

===Text Lists



There is no selection by default. The facet selected gives the index of selected
string or none value if no selection (read/write).

	layout [
		below
		chosen: text "empty"	
		all-days: text-list 
		data days: copy [ "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" ] 
		[ chosen/data: pick days all-days/selected ]
	]

===Images

By default an image will be scaled to fit within a face.

	image 60x60 %palms.jpg

Most other faces can accept an image as well as text:

	box 100x100 %palms.jpg
	button "Button" %palms.jpg

The image can be provided as a filename, URL, or image data.

===Backdrops

A backdrop can be a color, or an image. For example a backdrop color would be
written as:

	backdrop navy
	text "Color Backdrop" gold

A backdrop image can be a file, URL, or image data:

	backdrop %palms.jpg
	text "Image Backdrop" red
